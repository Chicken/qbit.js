# qBit.js

A qBittorrent library made with TypeScript.  
Aiming to support the latest API version (at the time of writing v2.9.3 for app version v4.6.4).  
Currently just a API wrapper, planning to be a proper client.  
Only supports ESM, go away with your CJS.  
Proper documentation is on the todo.
